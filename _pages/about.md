Thank you for visiting my website! 
My name is Minyoung Kim, and I am a PhD Candidate at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. My research interests include political psychology, values, polarization, and experimental methods. I am specifically interested in the role that values play in political attitudes and partisanship.

Why do I study American Politics? 
======
I moved to the United States from South Korea when I was 15. I lived in South Carolina, Maryland, Oregon, Massachusetts, and California. This naturally prompted the question - why and how Americans came to hold such varied values, and how values and different lifestyles relate to the political attitudes they hold.
