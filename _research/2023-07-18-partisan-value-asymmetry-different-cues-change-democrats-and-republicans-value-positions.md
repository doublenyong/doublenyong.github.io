excerpt: 'Can Basic Human Values be utilized to reduce affective polarization? While focusing on shared values and common goals is a well-known component of the optimal conditions for mitigating intergroup tensions (Allport 1954; Pettigrew and Tropp 2006), study of values as the medium to reduce prejudice and affective polarization remains surprisingly unexplored. According to existing research, 10 Basic Human Values form a value structure that is universally found across all human cultures (Schwartz 1994). In the United States, despite partisan polarization, Democrats and Republicans both rate Basic Human Values equally highly. Therefore, even though values might not seem so potent amidst heavy social cleavages and partisan biases, I argue that highlighting the shared basic human values will help reduce the intergroup animosity and draw greater tolerance regarding controversial issues and personalities.'
